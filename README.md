# Uncle Joey's Base
Uncle Joey's Base provides some essential client-side addons for your BeamMP server, such as:
- a message of the day (MOTD)
- player restrictions (limiting respawns, resets, menu options etc.)
- realtime time syncing

## Getting started
1. Download the latest release
2. Place the .zip file in your Resources/Client folder on your server
3. Configure the addon using the `config.lua` file
4. Optionally add or replace images (supports gifs) in the `ui/uj_base` folder

### MOTD BBCodes
You can use BBCodes in your MOTD, `config.lua` contains a sample.
